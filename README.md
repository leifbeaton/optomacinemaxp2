# optomacinemaxp2
Optoma Cinemax P2 API to ADB

Container build to expose a RESTful API to control an Optoma Cinemax P2 projector - and likely other Android based projectors as well.

Instructions to follow, but if you're half familiar with docker this is a cakewalk to set up. The server.py can be used on its own if you prefer to run it outside of containers, but ensure ADB is installed and present on said system.
